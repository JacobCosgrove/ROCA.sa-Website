1)	Download and configure WampServer – steps 1 through 4.1 at this link: https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/installing-a-local-server/wampserver/. If you can’t download Wamp through this site, just go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/ and download there, then use the instructions from the other page to configure.
2)	Download 4330code folder from our GitHub and save it under the www directory of the Wamp server.
3)	Set up database by going to localhost/phpmyadmin, logging in with username “root” and no password. Create a new database and import the SQL file “4330project.sql” from the GitHub folder.
4)	Go to localhost/<file path to home page> to open the website. 
    i.e. http://localhost/4330code/index.php
5)	Use credentials user[ST@gmail.com, root] or company[pdvsa@gmail.com, root] to log in.
